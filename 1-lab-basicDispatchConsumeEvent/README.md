# Lab 1: Basic Dispatch Consume
[English](README.md) | [Bahasa Indonesia](README-id.md)

In this workshop, you will build 2 AWS Lambda Functions. One AWS Lambda Function (as the producer) will dispatch events, and one AWS Lambda Function (as the consumer) to receive events. In addition to receiving events, Consumer will also print logs to AWS CloudWatch Logs to ensure the flow is going well.

## Tasks
These are the tasks that you need to complete. If at some point you are stuck, please refer to the primary reference located at `source/` folder. 

### Step 0: Prepare work folder and boto3
#### Install boto3 library
- Open your terminal
- Run this command
```bash
pip install boto3
```

#### Preparing work folder
- Navigate to `work/` folder
- You will find 2 sub-directories named `cdk` and `lambda-functions`
- Navigate to `work/lambda-functions/` 
- You will find another 2 sub-directories named `consume-function` and `dispatch-function` 

### Step 1: Open Producer file
- Navigate to `work/lambda-functions/dispatch-function`
- Open `app.py`
- Read the file thoroughly as starting from next steps, you need to work on this file.


### Step 2: Sending an event
- Send an event to Amazon EventBridge with this following info:
	- Source: lab1-bdc-dispatch
	- DetailType: message-received
	- Detail: [Need to be in JSON format]
		```json
		{"title":"This is a test message", "test": true} 
		```
	- EventBusName: < Need to obtain from environment variable named: "EVENT_BUS_NAME" >

>**üí° HINT**
>- You need to create a client to connect to AWS resources. On Python, you need to use boto3 library. 
>- Use put_events() API to send event to Amazon EventBridge. Here's the [link](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/events.html).

> ### üòï Are you stuck?
> See the solution [here](https://github.com/donnieprakoso/workshop-eventDrivenMicroservices/blob/master/1-lab-basicDispatchConsumeEvent/source/lambda-functions/dispatch-function/app.py)

### Step 3: Create Consumer with AWS Lambda
- Navigate to `work/lambda-functions/consume-function`
- Open `app.py`
- Logs `event` variable to Amazon CloudWatch Logs

>**üí° HINT**
>- Python `print` command in AWS Lambda Functions will send the output to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. 

> ### üòï Are you stuck?
> See the solution [here](https://github.com/donnieprakoso/workshop-eventDrivenMicroservices/blob/master/1-lab-basicDispatchConsumeEvent/source/lambda-functions/consume-function/app.py)

### Step 4: Create an AWS CDK app
- Navigate to `work/cdk/`
- Create a file named `cdk.json`
- Open `cdk.json` and write these lines. These lines are to give a set of instruction for AWS CDK on how to build this app.
```json
{
	"app":"python3 app.py",
	"context":{}
}
```
- Open `app.py`. In this file, you see that we are missing few things to make this as a complete code. Read the file thoroughly and go to the next steps below.

### Step 5: Define Amazon EventBridge Construct and Pattern
- **You don't need to do anything.** This is already been provided in the `app.py` file.
### Step 6: Define IAM Permissions
- **You don't need to do anything.** This is already been provided in the `app.py` file.
### Step 7: Define AWS Lambda Construct for Producer
- **You don't need to do anything.** This is already been provided in the `app.py` file.
### Step 8: Define AWS Lambda Construct for Consumer
- **You don't need to do anything.** This is already been provided in the `app.py` file.
### Step 9: Define Amazon EventBridge Rule
- You'll need to define the Amazon EventBridge rule and attaching to respective constructs. 
- Here are the details that you need to include:
	- enabled: True (If it's false, then this rule is disabled)
	- event_bus: eb (Need to add reference to the `eb` variable)
	- event_pattern: eb_pattern (Need to add a reference to `eb_pattern`)
	- targets: (Need to add reference to fnLambda_consume)

>**üí° HINT**
>- Defining Amazon EventBridge rule is quite straightforward. Here's the API reference [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/python/aws_cdk.aws_events/Rule.html).
>- Don't forget to add the target to this rule. Amazon EventBridge provides various integration for AWS services. Here's the API reference [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/python/aws_cdk.aws_events_targets/LambdaFunction.html) to attach to AWS Lambda Function.

### Step 10: Tagging your AWS CDK App
- You need to open `app.py` and add these following lines. It's pretty handy to keep these lines so you can tag your CDK app.
```python
app = core.App()
stack = CdkStack(app, "Lab1-BasicDispatchConsume")
core.Tags.of(stack).add('Name','Lab1-BasicDispatchConsume')
app.synth()
```
### Step 11: Install all required libraries to build CDK app
- Navigate to `work/cdk/`
- Create a file named `requirements.txt`. This is a standard method to install any dependencies for Python applications. 
- Add these lines:
```
aws-cdk.core==1.70.0
aws-cdk.aws-lambda==1.70.0
aws-cdk.aws-iam==1.70.0
aws-cdk.aws-events==1.70.0
aws-cdk.aws-events-targets==1.70.0
```
- Install the libraries by executing:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 12: Deploy
- Open terminal and navigate to `work/cdk/`
- Deploy the app by executing:
```bash
cdk deploy
```
### Step 13: Testing
- Navigate to AWS Lambda Functions [dashboard](https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home). 
- Make sure that you're in the same AWS region as you deployed your application. 
- Find the **Producer** Lambda function. To filter based on the name, you can type "BasicDispatchConsume" on the filter text input. 
- Open the link which will navigate you to the AWS Lambda Function

#### Invoking Producer Function
Now we are going to test the Producer function which will trigger an event to Amazon EventBridge and will be consumed by the Consumer function as well as print the logs into CloudWatch. 

- Navigate to the **Test** page by clicking the **Test** tab
- In the configure Test event page, choose **New event** and in Event template, leave the default Hello World option. 
- Enter an Event name and provide an empty template:
```json
{}
``` 
- Click **Save changes** and then click **Test**.

#### Let's check the log on Amazon CloudWatch Logs
- Navigate to Amazon CloudWatch Log groups [dashboard](https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=ap-southeast-1#logsV2:log-groups).
- Find the logs for the **Consumer** function. To filter based on the name, you can type "BasicDispatchConsume" on the filter text input. 
- Find and open the latest Log Stream.
- If you see there's a JSON with data from event passed by the **Producer** via Amazon EventBridge, then you've completed this workshop.
